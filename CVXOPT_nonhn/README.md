# Non-holonomic MPC using CVXOPT

Non-holonomic Model Predictive Control using CVXOPT in Python.

### Instructions to run

```
cd CVXOPT_nonhn
Run all cells in the notebook main.ipynb
In your terminal, run: ./mkmovie.sh to generate simulation videos.
```

### Theoretical derivation

Refer to the pdf `non-holonomic.pdf` for details on linearization of constraints, cost function etc.

### CVXOPT Demo

A demo usage of CVXOPT for QP optimization is implemented in `CVX_demo.ipynb`.
